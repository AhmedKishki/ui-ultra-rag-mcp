"""The clients view, the SQL console, the sidebar that holds them, and its styles.

A host may serve this workspace and still not be a server — a stdio-only process
has no other client to report — so both the capability and the two routes are off
until a host turns them on, and a host that turns them on without the methods is
told so rather than raising.

A store this library cannot know about is the same case: the SQL panel ships
hidden and only an adapter that declares `sql_console` fills it, because the
scopes it offers and the statements it will run are the adapter's decisions.

One installation serving several projects is the same case again: the selector
and the client entry are the host's facts, so both ship behind a flag and neither
is composed here.

The navigation is a sidebar rather than a strip, and the page is built on a
spacing and type scale rather than on values typed into each rule. Both are here
because a reader who cannot see the page described as cramped is not served by an
assertion about a class name.
